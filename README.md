# Literate Programming with Entangled, Gitpod and MkDocs

This repository is a template to create beautiful literate programs with Entangled and Mkdocs.

In order to make it easier to start writing your documentation this also runs as a Gitpod instance.
So you only need to fork this repository and open it on gitpod:

https://gitpod.io/#prebuild/<github_address_of_your_fork>

And you can start write your documentation right away.

Now this is also a literate programming environment.
Using https://entangled.github.io.

That means that code fragments you write in your makrdown files get extracted automatically and exposed as files.

Take a look at 'docs/index.md' to learn how the dockerfile that allows this project to be executed in GitPod get's generated.

And the continuous integration github action.
